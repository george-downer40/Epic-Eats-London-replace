Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **March 3rd, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

Happy coding!

# Epic Eats London

Epic Eats London is a site that provides a platform for users to share their favourite places to eat in London, be they restaurants, pubs, takeaways or food stalls. London has seen an explosion in great places to eat over the last 5 years, and this site is intended to help people share their most epic eats and find new places to try across London.

Visitors to the site are able to see some of the most popular posts from its users (based on a like / favourite rating), but only registered users can create posts, like / favourite posts, and comment on other posts. The site administrator will have the ability to review posts and comments, and delete any inappropriate content. Both registered users and the site administrator will have CRUD functionality, but the registered user will only have CRUD functionality on their own posts and comments, whereas the site admin will have CRUD functionality over all content posted on the site.

# Agile User Stories

As an unregistered site visitor / 1st time visitor I can see what the purpose of the site is so I know what the site is about and if it interests me

As an unregistered user I can create a new account on the site so that I can access the full features of the site

As a registered user I can log into my account on the site so that I can view my posts, other users posts, favourited posts and comments
